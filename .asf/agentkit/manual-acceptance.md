# AgentKit manual acceptance checklist

This is a deployed instruction file, not evidence of completion or consent.

- Verify the target `cedricmenec/asf-agentkit-qualification`, default branch `main`,
  backlog convention `backlog/tasks/AQ-NNN.md`, and `openspec/config.yaml`.
- Independently configure a `check` script in `package.json` or change the
  reviewed kit setting to the target's script `check`.
- Review GitHub App installation and permissions. Variable `APP_ID`,
  secrets `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` need manual owner setup;
  the kit never writes or displays them.
- Audit GitHub Settings protection/required CI independently. Do not infer
  applied rules from checked-in configuration.
- Every workflow dispatch may use paid model calls. The repository owner must
  explicitly type `I_AUTHORIZE_ONE_PAID_PHASE` for EACH first-attempt phase.
- Do not re-run a failed paid job. Inspect the remote branch, PR and provider
  usage first; a later phase requires a new authorization.
- Keep every resulting PR in draft until independent CI at its exact SHA and
  required manual acceptance are verified. No auto-merge is installed.

This runtime intentionally does not install the GitHub App, secrets or rulesets.
